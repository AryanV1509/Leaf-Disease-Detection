# Leaf-Disease-Detection
This repository contains an implementation of a leaf disease detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The goal of this project is to assist farmers and gardeners in identifying and managing plant diseases early by accurately detecting and classifying diseases from leaf images.
Achieved **98.3%** test accuracy.
## Features
**Dataset Preparation:** Collection, preprocessing, and augmentation of leaf images to build a robust dataset for training the model.
**Model Architecture:** Design and implementation of a CNN model specifically for the task of leaf disease classification.
**Training and Validation:** Scripts for training the model with options for hyperparameter tuning, as well as validating the model performance.
**Evaluation:** Comprehensive evaluation metrics and visualizations to assess the modelâ€™s accuracy and effectiveness.
**Prediction:** A script to make predictions on new leaf images, providing real-time disease detection.
**User Interface:** A simple web interface to upload leaf images and display the predicted disease, if any.
## Dataset
The project utilizes a publicly available leaf disease dataset, which includes images of healthy and diseased leaves of various plants. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to ensure the reliability of model evaluation.
